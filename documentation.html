    <h1>Planwise Documentation</h1>
    <p>Planwise is super simple to use and setup on your wordpress implementation.  You have two options on how to use it</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As a <a href="#shortcode">shortcode</a></li>
        <li>As a <a href="#page-template">page template</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="shortcode">Using Planwise as a shortcode</h2>
    <p>All that you need to do to use the planwise shortcode is put it into a page or post.  The planwise shortcode is :</p>
    <pre><code>[planwise]</code></pre>
    <p>please remember that you will be to have a full page with available to you as the iframe is 100% of the screen width.</p>

    <h2 id="page-template">Using the planwise page template</h2>
    <p>The page template is already setup to be the right size and to automatically show the planwise iframe.  To put the iframe in your theme, all you need to do is click on the planwise menu item on the left of this screen, go to the bottom of the configuration page and click the blue button that says "copy planwise template".</p>
    <p>If there is any problems copying the template (if the server does not have the rights to copy it), then you will need to copy it yourself. This is very simple and only means using FTP to copy the file <br/><code>/wp-content/plugins/planwise/page-planwise.php</code><br/> to your local machine and then back up to the server to <br /><code>/wp-content/themes/your-theme/page-planwise.php</code> (where "your-theme" is the them you are using). </p>
    <h2>Changing the background color</h2>
    <p>On the configuration page it is also possible to change the background color of the iframe, just use the color selector and make sure that "set as transparent" is unchecked.</p>
